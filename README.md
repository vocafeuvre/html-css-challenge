## 100 Days of HTML/CSS
This is a repo holding all of my work during my self-imposed 100 Days of HTML/CSS. No Javascript, just pure HTML/CSS.

- 4/26/2019: I worked on trying out basic layouts using HTML/CSS, such as a content page.
  - folders: contentpage
- 5/2/2019: I finished a dashboard. "I was busy with other things" is the reason why I didn't finish it on 4/27, but I'm sure the time I spend coding this amounted to one day.
  - folders: dashboard

### Things to note
- My goal here is to code first the page, then refactor if I have time after. Due to this, the CSS may be poorly written.
